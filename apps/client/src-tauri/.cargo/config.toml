# Cargo configuration for Boreal
# This prevents cargo from trying to cross-compile for mobile targets during desktop development

# Default target for development (macOS arm64)
# Comment this out when building for other desktop platforms
[build]
# Uncomment if you want to force native host target:
# target = "aarch64-apple-darwin"

# Linker configuration for cross-compilation
[target.aarch64-linux-android]
# This target is only valid when building with Android NDK
# Cargo will skip it during desktop development due to cfg guards in Cargo.toml

[target.aarch64-apple-ios]
# This target is only valid when building for iOS
